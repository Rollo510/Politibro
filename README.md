POLITIBRO RAILS PROJECT

POLITIBRO is a Rails-designed web app that is essentially a forum for posting political memes and commenting on them.  Users must log in either through Facebook, or by signing up for an account using their email address.  Users can post new memes by clicking on Create New Meme and pasting an image URL along with a brief description of the image.  From there, other users can see and post comments on these images.  The idea is for this website to be highly toxic and cause a lot of drama, because our current political climate is extremely chaotic as well.

Prerequisites: To be safe, you will need the latest version of Ruby. The bundler/setup should take care of most of what you need, but to be safe, you'll need to have access to the gems in the bundler.
